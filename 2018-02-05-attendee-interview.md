# Attendee Interview Script

### Goal

Attract people with diverse skills and backgrounds to participate in Code for DC.

### Objectives

* Learn about positive Code for DC experiences and the paths people take to reach them.
* Identify unanswered questions, problems, or concerns that might lead an interested person to not participate.
* Study whether the existing Code for DC web presence is addressing these needs.

## Introduction

> Hi, I’m [introduce yourselves]. We’re working on a project to improve the Code for DC website, and we’re interviewing other attendees in order to understand more about the experience of participating in Code for DC. If you’re interested in participating, we would love to hear about your experience. The interview will take twenty minutes or less, and all feedback will be anonymous. Can we talk?

If yes, proceed to questions.

## Exploratory Questions (10–12 minutes)

The goal when conducting an exploratory interview is to have a conversation related to the objectives above. So although the questions below are a useful reference to keep the conversation on track, this isn’t a survey, and we don’t want to just run through the list in order. Some questions will be more or less relevant to different people.

Tangents are okay, and sometimes they’re golden! For example, the person you’re talking to might bring up experiences with other meetups. If it feels right, explore those stories and ask follow-up questions; they probably inform how the person thinks about Code for DC. If things get too disconnected, try and softly bring the conversation back on topic.

### Introduction

* When did you first attend Code for DC?
  * How many project nights have you attended?
* What projects have you worked on?
* What do you do professionally?
  * Do you use the same or different skills when working on Code for DC projects?
  * Are you currently studying [skills] outside of Code for DC?

### Topic

* Question

## Think-Aloud Tasks (2x, 3–4 minutes each)

> Next we’ll need to use your computer and web browser. I’m going to ask you to complete a couple of tasks. This is not a test of you, and there are no right or wrong answers. As you complete the tasks, I’d like you to narrate what you’re thinking, what you’re looking for, what you expect to find, and your thoughts and opinions about what you’re seeing. Do you have any questions for me?

### Tasks

You’ll want to select two of these tasks that are relevant to the individual. In addition to the tasks below, you might improvise a new task based on the discussion during the exploratory interview.

Also note that there are multiple ways to complete some of these tasks. For example, the first task could be answered either by going to the Projects page on the Code for DC website, or by looking at the codefordc GitHub organization.

You should never take charge of the mouse/trackpad. If someone does get well and truly stuck, you can suggest how to get back on track, but this is the option of last resort, and should only be done after asking about what the participant is looking for and where they expect to find it.

* Show me how you would find information about current Code for DC projects.
  * How hard or easy was it to find this information?
  * What questions would you have to understand whether you might want to work on a project? Does this page answer those questions?
  * How would you go about learning whether the project has open tasks that you could work on?
* Show me how you would find out when is the next Code for DC project night?
  * How hard or easy was it to find this information?
  * Is everything you would need to know to attend the next project night on this page?
  * What would you do next?
* Show me where you would go to find out whether Code for DC has a code of conduct.
  * How hard or easy was it to find this information?
  * Is there anything confusing about this page?
  * If you needed to report a violation of the code of conduct, how would you do that?

### Prompts

Often times, the participant will fall silent; we’re not accustomed to monologuing about our web browsing. You can ask prompts like:

* Is this what you expected to find on this page?
* What are your impressions of this page?
* Do you like this page?
* What do you notice about this page?
* Does this page make sense to you?
* Can you tell me about what you’re looking for?
* What [did/do] you expect to happen when you [action]?

## Conclusion

> Thank you so much for taking the time to share your thoughts today. Do you have any other questions for me?
