## Takeaways

* Seems to be a fairly experienced engineer. Stuck around because of the people, because he enjoyed being able to make decisions, and work on a team with complementary skillsets.
* Likes that there are no recruiters, no "ulterior motive."
* Recency and activity is an important way he evaluates projects.

## Notes

**When did you first attend Code for DC?**

Over two years ago. Before DCAF started. I met Colin at the very first one I came to, but there was no code yet.

**How often have you attended?**

"On and off." More than once a month.

**What projects have you worked on?**

DCAF. "I feel like a senior consultant, almost." Made decisions about database, about encryption, unit testing. "I've written like [holds fingers close together] this much code."

**What do you do professionally?**

I'm a CI engineer. I do a lot of Git stuff.

**Similar to what you do here?**

I get to actually make architectural opinions here.

**How did you first hear about Code for DC?**

I was just looking for tech events in DC.

**Have you stuck with any of the others?**

This is the only hands-on one that I stuck with. I also go to some more social meetups (CDK, DCJS, Data Science DC, e.g.).

"I've been to the big tech events, but they feel very stuffy."

Attended Code for DC within a couple of weeks of learning about it.

**What got you to come?**

"It was really close." The first one was in Chinatown, and I was working in Union Station.

**What kept you coming back?**

"Colin, because he's such an awesome dude."

**What excited you about Code for DC?**

It's hands-on. There's no ulterior motive. No recruiters.

**Was there anything you found intimidating or confusing?**

Right now I'm project-less, but that's mostly because I'm a ruby coder, and there aren't any ruby projects.

**Did you have expectations of the skill level?**

"I was hoping that most people would be more skilled than I was so there would be an opportunity to pick up on stuff." People were less familiar with Rails, but more familiar with the other stuff. So I brought in the one thing I could do, and others filled in the gaps. Mentions Molly and UX. Others were good with front-end stuff. "They were much better than I was."

**Have you been to codefordc.org?**

A long time ago.

It took me a long time to find that Slack link.

There's like a list of projects, but it's tough to know whether they are active, whether they are [gestures to indicate at Social Tables] here.


**Think Aloud**

**How would you find information about current projects?**

Googles "code for dc."

Goes to the three-up on the homepage first. Then goes to projects.

There's a spinner that stays open on the page.

**How would you find open tasks?**

Goes to the individual GitHub repos, and clicks over to the issues tab. Judges the pages based on how old the issues are. Rules out those from 2016 and older.

I would like to know who's in charge. Who to go to for questions.

Finds the open issues link on the projects page, but is looking for a sense of recency.

**How would you find out when the next project night is?**

Goes to the website, and knows where to click to get to the Meetup page. They've redesigned Meetup recently, but he quickly locates the upcoming meetings on the left.

**How easy or hard?**

It was not super easy, but there's nothing hard about. 2 out of 5. 1 being easy.
