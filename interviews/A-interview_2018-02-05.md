## Takeaways

### Interview portion

* This is A's first Code for DC. Has been to Code for SF events in the past. 
	* "Seems similar" to Code for SF (have pizza, have communal meeting space). Code for SF had a few core projects and then a few new ones every meetup. 
	* Likes that Code for DC has a project aimed at beginners. "Less hypertech than SF was, where everyone is like 'I just graduated from a bootcamp!'". 
	* Worked on project for Small Biz Association in SF, specific deliverable --proposal for the USDS to get funding for SBA. Had a prototype and a presentation with a very clear goal and outcome of project.
	* Heard about Code for SF from a former CfA fellow, "a network to meet people in a fun, relaxed "
		* Looked up Code for DC yesterday (2/4)

* A works for Ad-Hoc, doing business stuff for the company, which works as a government contractor. 
	* Works on a lot of non-technical things, so appreciates working on non-technical projects. "There's always a need for non-technical people"
	* Currently learning Google Analytics and similar systems for work -- GitHub issues, project tracking

* Arrived to Code for DC and someone talked immediately about databases and "what do you do" and felt overwhelmed ("it was a little much...the table I was sitting at felt very cut off")

* What are you hoping to get out of coming to Code for DC?
	* "Friends!"
	* Working on technical stuff

* Were you aware of what kind of skills were needed to attend Code for DC?
	* "Generally familiar" with the world of tech

* What did you expect the skill level to be?
	* Wasn't too intimidated, as "a person in tech who doesn't know tech". Used to listening ("I know all the words now") and nodding along


* What do you wish you had known coming here?
	* Found it hard to find the Code for DC website and how often meetups occur. Saw there were 100 people going to the meetup online, but definitely not 100 people here. Very convenient location (works across the street from SocialTables).
	* Only thing she found on the website was something that looked "github-like". Would like to see better SEO--when she googled "Code for DC", the website did not come up!

* What worked well about the site?
	* Was affiliated with Code for America, so she knew it was the right place. Doesn't think that she would have felt as confident coming here if she hadn't already been to Code for SF and known what it was all about. 

* Looks for activities that don't have a "high price of commitment, either financially or high time commitment". Also like learning new skills and when an activity incentivizes people to come back. 

* Would you tell a friend about Code for DC?
	* Yes!



### Think-aloud Tasks

* How would you find the next meetup?
	* Googled "Code for DC", found the page. The Code for DC homepage has a link to Meetup, and the date/time/location of the next meetup on the front page.
	* "Easy" to find the next meetup. Might have gotten confused because she was originally searching for "Codefordc.org" on Meetup.com and couldn't find the event
	* Yes, everything she would need to know to attend is available on Meetup.com
	* Meetup page does not say there is food available

* How would you find the code of conduct?
	* Found it right away
	* Was able to find "Contact a Captain" info but "would not feel comfortable" following any of the instructions 
		* Probably unlikely to report a violation "I don't like sending emails when i don't know who they're going to"
		* Would feel better if there was a google form or a person to message on slack. "I work with google forms a lot and they're colorful and generally someone checks them and sends a confirmation that you submitted it. Looks more like it goes somewhere". Unclear who would even get the email from the anonymous contact form.

* What else do you notice about the homepage?
	* Lots of exclamation points, lots of hyperlinks. 
	* Likes "Stuff we've made" header
	* Does seeing "Stuff we've made" make you like Code for DC more?
		* Projects "seem cool" 

* Other feedback
	* How do i sign up? is there an email list?
	* Looks "sad" -- "it's black and white and has hyperlinks. This looks like one of those spammy websites that they tell you not to click on."
	* "If i hadn't been to a prior Code for America-themed event I probaboy wouldn't go to this one"
	* No pictures of people
	* No "Hey, you don't know tech, but that's ok you should come hang out!"
	* If designing the page herself, would make it more animated and modern
	* About page still makes it look "kind of scary" -- why aren't profile pictures aligned?
	* Would have liked to see the "About Us" article links on the front page, would have made the group look way more interesting 
	* Spent some time on the CfA brigade page -- liked the Code for Hawaii page's look, but it didn't have anything about events
